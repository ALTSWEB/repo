# Skydiver-Web
A deployable version of Skydiver-Web.
Inspired and sourced heavily from Hypertabs.
Basically a modified faster version that is a spinoff called Skydiver-Web.

300 Something Commits Later I Finally Finished. 

Website: https://skydiver-web.hop.sh or https://skydiver-web.1.us-1.fl0.io

Currently optimizing Skydiver-Web to make it as fast as possible, but speed mostly depends on the computer you run it on.
